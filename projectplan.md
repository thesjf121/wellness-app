# Project Plan: Update MockAuth to Clerk in Remaining Components

## Overview
Update all remaining components that import and use MockAuth to use Clerk instead. This continues the migration from the mock authentication system to the real Clerk authentication.

## Todo Items

- [x] Update GroupManagement.tsx to use Clerk
- [x] Update CreateGroupModal.tsx to use Clerk
- [x] Update GroupActivityFeed.tsx to use Clerk
- [x] Update JoinGroupModal.tsx to use Clerk
- [x] Fix TypeScript compilation errors in ClerkErrorBoundary.tsx
- [x] Fix UserResource email property access in ProfilePage.tsx

## Approach
For each component:
1. Replace `import { useMockAuth } from '../../context/MockAuthContext';` with `import { useUser } from '@clerk/clerk-react';`
2. Replace `const { user } = useMockAuth();` with `const { user } = useUser();`
3. If auth status is needed, also import and use `useAuth` from `@clerk/clerk-react`
4. Handle any differences in the user object structure

## Changes
The key changes are:
- Import: `import { useUser } from '@clerk/clerk-react';`
- Usage: `const { user } = useUser();`
- For auth status: `import { useAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-react';` and `const { isSignedIn } = useAuth();`

## Review

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated GroupManagement.tsx**:
   - Replaced `import { useMockAuth } from '../../context/MockAuthContext';` with `import { useUser } from '@clerk/clerk-react';`
   - Changed `const { user } = useMockAuth();` to `const { user } = useUser();`
   - User object structure remains compatible (user.id works the same way)

2. **Updated CreateGroupModal.tsx**:
   - Replaced MockAuth import with Clerk useUser hook
   - Updated user hook usage
   - All user property access remains compatible

3. **Updated GroupActivityFeed.tsx**:
   - Replaced MockAuth import with Clerk useUser hook
   - Updated user hook usage
   - No changes needed for user property access

4. **Updated JoinGroupModal.tsx**:
   - Replaced MockAuth import with Clerk useUser hook
   - Updated user hook usage
   - All functionality preserved

5. **Fixed ClerkErrorBoundary.tsx TypeScript errors**:
   - Fixed type casting issue by using `error as unknown as ClerkAPIError`
   - Simplified error logging to only include available properties

6. **Fixed ProfilePage.tsx email access**:
   - Changed `user.email` to `user.primaryEmailAddress?.emailAddress` to match Clerk UserResource structure

### Summary:
Successfully updated all remaining group components from MockAuth to Clerk authentication. The migration maintains full functionality while using the production-ready Clerk authentication system. All TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved, and the application builds successfully with only minor ESLint warnings (unused variables and useEffect dependencies) that don't affect functionality.
