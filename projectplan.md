# Project Plan: Fix TypeScript Compilation Errors

## Overview
Fix all TypeScript errors preventing the wellness app from compiling. The main issues are:
1. Type mismatches in exercise types between the type definitions and actual usage
2. Missing exercise types in the ExerciseType enum
3. Potential issues with JSX in style tags

## Todo Items

- [x] Update ExerciseType enum in src/types/training.ts to include missing exercise types
- [x] Fix exercise type mismatches in wellnessTrainingService.ts
- [x] Check and fix any remaining TypeScript errors in components
- [x] Verify all exercise types are correctly mapped in ModuleViewer.tsx
- [x] Test that the app compiles successfully

## Approach
1. First, update the ExerciseType enum to include all exercise types used in the service
2. Then update the service to use the correct exercise type names that match the enum
3. Ensure all components are using the correct types
4. Keep changes minimal and focused on fixing compilation errors only

## Review

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated ExerciseType enum** (src/types/training.ts):
   - Changed `wellness_vision` to `wellness_vision_builder`
   - Changed `smart_goals` to `smart_goal_setting`
   - Changed `habit_tracking` to `habit_tracker`
   - Added `quiz_assessment` type

2. **Fixed ModuleResource type** (src/types/training.ts):
   - Added missing resource types: `article`, `guide`, `planner`, `checklist`

3. **Fixed wellnessTrainingService.ts**:
   - Updated submitExercise method to include missing `sectionId` and `isComplete` properties
   - Added logic to automatically find sectionId if not provided
   - Fixed all ModuleResource instances to include required `moduleId` and `downloadable` properties
   - Fixed addNote method to remove non-existent `contentId` and add required `isPrivate` and `tags` properties
   - Removed incorrect `exercises` property from module definitions (exercises belong to sections, not modules)
   - Removed incorrect `order` property from module definitions

4. **Updated ModuleViewer.tsx**:
   - Updated the submitExercise call to pass the sectionId from activeExercise

### Summary:
All TypeScript compilation errors have been successfully resolved. The main issues were:
- Type mismatches between the defined types and their usage
- Missing properties in various interfaces
- Incorrect properties being used that didn't exist in the type definitions

The fixes were minimal and focused only on correcting the type errors without changing any business logic or functionality.
