- **Data Protection**: Encryption, secure storage
- **API Security**: Request validation, rate limiting
- **Input Validation**: XSS, injection prevention
- **Privacy Compliance**: Data handling according to policies

### 6. Accessibility Testing
**Goal**: Ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards
**Coverage**: All user interfaces and interactions

#### Test Categories:
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**: VoiceOver, TalkBack
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order, focus management
- **Color Contrast**: Visual accessibility requirements
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum size and spacing
- **Alternative Text**: Images and interactive elements

### 7. Cross-Platform Testing
**Goal**: Ensure consistent functionality across all supported platforms
**Coverage**: All features on iOS, Android, and Web

#### Platform Matrix:
- **iOS**: 14.0+, iPhone SE to iPhone 15 Pro Max
- **Android**: API 30+ (Android 11+), various screen sizes
- **Web**: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge (latest 2 versions)

## Test Environments

### 1. Development Environment
- **Purpose**: Developer testing during development
- **Data**: Mock data and services
- **Access**: Development team only

### 2. Staging Environment
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing
- **Data**: Sanitized production-like data
- **Access**: QA team and stakeholders

### 3. Production Environment
- **Purpose**: Live monitoring and incident testing
- **Data**: Real user data (with consent)
- **Access**: Authorized personnel only

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Categories:
1. **User Accounts**: Various user types and states
2. **Health Data**: Step counts, nutrition entries
3. **Social Data**: Groups, messages, activities
4. **Training Data**: Module progress, achievements
5. **System Data**: Settings, preferences, notifications

### Data Privacy:
- All test data anonymized
- No real PII in non-production environments
- GDPR/CCPA compliant data handling

## Test Execution Schedule

### Phase 1: Foundation Testing (Week 1-2)
- Set up testing infrastructure
- Unit tests for core services
- Basic integration tests
- Initial accessibility audit

### Phase 2: Feature Testing (Week 3-4)
- Complete unit test suite
- Integration test implementation
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Performance baseline testing

### Phase 3: User Experience Testing (Week 5-6)
- End-to-end test scenarios
- Usability testing sessions
- Accessibility compliance testing
- Security penetration testing

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (Week 7-8)
- Load and stress testing
- Beta user testing program
- Bug fixing and retesting
- Final security audit

## Success Criteria

### Quality Gates:
1. **Unit Tests**: 80%+ code coverage, all tests passing
2. **Integration Tests**: All critical paths covered, 95%+ passing
3. **Performance**: <3s load time, <500MB memory usage
4. **Security**: No high/critical vulnerabilities
